## NMOS Analysis

Let us understand the DC behavior of an NMOS transistor and its response to varying voltages especially how the NMOS transistor conducts when gate (Vin) and drain (Vdd) voltages change, by designing a simple nmose circuit and obtaining SPICE simulation

Observation:
The output of the NMOS transistor is analyzed by varying Vin and Vdd.
As Vin (gate-to-source voltage) increases, the output current rises until it reaches a saturation point, beyond which further increases in Vin have little effect.
Similarly, increasing Vdd results in a higher output current, reflecting the transistorâ€™s dependence on the drain-to-source voltage.
